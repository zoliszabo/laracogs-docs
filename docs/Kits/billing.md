# Application Billing

If you feel like opting in for the Laracogs starter kit. You can also get your app's billing handled quickly with Laracogs billing command and `Laravel/Cashier`. Laracog's billing will build a basic controller, views etc so you can stay focused on what makes your application amazing!

##### Requires
```php
composer require laravel/cashier
```

## Setup
```
php artisan laracogs:billing
```

You have to modify the `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` in the `mapWebRoutes(Router $router)` function:

You will see a line like: `->group(base_path('routes/web.php'));`

You need to change it to resemble this:
```php
->group(function () {
    require base_path('routes/web.php');
    require base_path('routes/billing.php');
}
```

Add this to the .env:
```php
SUBSCRIPTION=app_basic
STRIPE_SECRET=secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLIC=public-key
```

Add this to the app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php:
```php
Gate::define('access-billing', function ($user) {
    return ($user->meta->subscribed('main') && is_null($user->meta->subscription('main')->endDate));
});
```

And for the `config/services.php` you will want yours to resemble:
```php
'stripe' => [
    'model'  => App\Models\UserMeta::class,
    'key'    => env('STRIPE_PUBLIC'),
    'secret' => env('STRIPE_SECRET'),
],
```

Finally run migrate to add the subscriptions and bind them to the user meta:
```php
php artisan migrate
```

You will also want to update your webpack mix file to resemble (webpack.mix.js):
```js
.js([
    'resources/assets/js/app.js',
    'resources/assets/js/card.js',
    'resources/assets/js/subscription.js'
], 'public/js');
```

### After Setup
You may want to add this line to your navigation:

```php
<li><a href="{!! url('user/billing/details') !!}"><span class="fa fa-dollar"></span> Billing</a></li>
```

### Notes
You may want to switch the line in the view vendor.receipt to:

```php
<strong>To:</strong> {{ $user->user()->email }}
```

We do this because rather than bind the billing to the User, we bound it to the UserMeta.

## What Billing Publishes

The command will overwrite any existing files with the billing version of them:

* app/Http/Controllers/User/BillingController.php
* app/Models/UserMeta.php
* config/invoice.php
* config/plans.php
* database/migrations/2016_02_26_000647_create_subscriptions_table.php
* database/migrations/2016_02_26_000658_add_billings_to_user_meta.php
* resources/assets/js/card.js
* resources/assets/js/subscription.js
* resources/views/billing/card-form.blade.php
* resources/views/billing/change-card.blade.php
* resources/views/billing/details.blade.php
* resources/views/billing/invoices.blade.php
* resources/views/billing/coupons.blade.php
* resources/views/billing/subscribe.blade.php
* resources/views/billing/tabs.blade.php
* routes/billing.php

## Accounts

The Account service is a tool for handling your subscription details, meaning you can limit your applications based on various clauses using the plans config. You're free to set these plan details restricting things within a billing cycle or just in general.

These are relative to *billing* only. They provide extra tools for handling restrictions in your application based on the plan the user subscribed to. Unless you implment the cashier billing system with the UserMeta structure provided by Laracogs it will not benefit you.

### Config
This is the basic config for `config/plans.php`. In this config you can define multiple plans which can have different rules per plan. By default the kit uses a single plan. You can define this in the env as mentioned above. But if you want to do multiple plans you can change the following code:

1. Line 45 of the `BillingController.php` change `config('plans.subscription')` to: `$payload['plan']`
2. Then add the following code in `resources/views/billing/subscribe.blade.php` above the card form include:

```
<div class="form-group">
    <select name="plan" class="form-control">
        @foreach (config('plans.plans') as $plan => $details)
            <option value="{{ $plan }}">{{ $plan }}</option>
        @endforeach
    </select>
</div>
```

> Remember you need to have corresponding plans on Stripe ex. app_basic by default

```
'subscription' => env('SUBSCRIPTION'),
'subscription_name' => 'main',
'plans' => [
    'app_basic' => [
        'access' => [
            'some name'
        ],
        'limits' => [
            'Model\Namespace' => 5,
            'pivot_table' => 1
        ],
        'credits' => [
            'column' => 'credits_spent',
            'limit' => 10
        ],
        'custom' => [
            'anything' => 'anything'
        ],
    ],
]
```

<br>
#### creditsUsed($model, $key = 'user_id', $value = {user's id})
